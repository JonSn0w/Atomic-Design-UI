# Atom Dark UI theme
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A complimentary Atomic UI theme for Atomic Monokai syntax

This UI theme was forked from [Atom Dark UI](https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui) and modified to compliment the [**Atomic Monokai**](https://github.com/JonSn0w/Atomic-Monokai-Syntax) syntax-highlighting package.

```

  After installation, the theme can be easily activated by going to the **Themes** section in the *Settings* view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.

*Keep in mind, this is my first attempt at creating a syntax theme for Atom, so if there are any issues please feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to fix them.*
